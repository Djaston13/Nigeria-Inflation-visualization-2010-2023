# Nigeria Inflation Visualization (2010â€“2023)

This beginner-friendly project presents a simple data visualization of Nigeria's inflation trend from 2010 to 2023 using Python. The project includes a mini dashboard with a line graph built using Matplotlib.

## Project Files
- `nigeria_inflation_dashboard.py`: The Python script that loads and visualizes the inflation data.
- `nigeria_inflation.csv`: The dataset (if supported on your device; otherwise use .tif as placeholder).
- `README.md`: This file.

## Features
- Reads inflation data from a CSV file
- Plots a clean line chart showing year vs inflation rate
- Saves the plot as an image (`nigeria_inflation.tif` or similar)
- Suitable for beginners practicing data visualization and file handling in Python

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pydroid 3)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Make sure `nigeria_inflation.csv` is in the same directory as your script.
2. Run the script in Pydroid 3.
3. The chart will be displayed and saved to your internal storage.
